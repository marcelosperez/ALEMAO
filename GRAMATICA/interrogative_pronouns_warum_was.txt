Finally, there are the interrogative pronouns, or “question words.” In German they’re sometimes called W-Wörter, since they all start with W. Most of them have a direct English equivalent:

Warum? = Why?
Was? = What?
Wann? = When?
Wie? = How?
Welche? = Which?

But "where" is a little more complicated:

Wo? = Where at?
Woher? = Where from?
Wohin? = Where to?

And "who" has a full set of case endings:

Wer? = Who? Nominative
Wen? = Who(m)? Accusative
Wem? = To who(m)? Dative
Wessen? = Whose? Genitive

Wo can also be added to the beginning of many prepositions to make a question word. If the preposition starts with a vowel, an “r” is inserted between them to make the pronunciation easier:

Wofür lebe ich? (=What am I living for?)
Worüber sprichst du? (=What are you talking about?)

As you can see, we usually do this using “what” in modern English, but it used to be a more direct equivalent – think of “Romeo, Romeo, wherefore [why, what for] art thou Romeo?”
“Which” in German is welch— and is fully declined according to gender and case (see Section II).

As in English, the interrogative pronouns can also sometimes be used as relative pronouns. Unlike the standard relative pronouns in the previous subsection, they are not declined:

Der Ort, wo ich zur Schule ging, ist nicht weit von hier. (=The place where I went to school is not far from here.)


Wer sind Sie?/Wer bist du? (= Who are you?)

Wer hat es gemacht? Who did it?
Mit wem bist du gekommen? Who did you come with?

Ich weiß nicht, wer es gemacht hat. I don’t know who did it.
Sie wollte wissen, mit wem sie fahren sollte. She wanted to know who she was to travel with.

Wodurch ist es zerstört worden? How was it destroyed?
Worauf sollen wir sitzen? Es gibt keine Stühle. What should we sit on? There aren’t any chairs.

„Sie hat jetzt ein Auto” – „Was für eins hat sie gekauft?“ “She has a car now.” - “What kind (of one) did she buy?”
