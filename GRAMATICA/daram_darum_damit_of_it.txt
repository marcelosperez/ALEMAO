daram, darum, damit (of it, with it, etc)
https://germantakeaways.com/what-does-davon-darauf-damit-mean-in-german/

(1) Wir haben gestern darüber gesprochen. (We talked about this yesterday)
(da+r+über = about this)

(2) Hast du ihm davon erzählt? (Did you tell him about this?)
(da+von = of this)

(3) Damit lernen wir Deutsch. (We are learning German with this)
(da+mit = with this)

Look for the verb: (1) sprechen, (2) erzählen (3) lernen.

Identify the preposition: (1) über, (2) von, (3) mit (if the preposition starts with a vowel, we have to put an -r- in the middle: da-r-über).

Combine them: (1) sprechen über, (2) erzählen von, (3) lernen mit.

In most cases, the resulting combination is a verb with a fixed preposition: 
(1) sprechen über (+ Akkusativ) = talk about
(2) erzählen von (+ Dativ) = tell (you can look them up in this table).

If the verb is not in the table (so maybe it’s not a verb with a fixed preposition), then it’s simply a preposition that makes sense with the verb: 

(3) Ich lerne mit einem Buch (I study with a book).

da(r)- means always “this” (referring to something mentioned in the preceding sentence or question. 

The word order is reverse (da+für = *”this for” → for this). We never say literally “for this” → *”für das” in German, we always say dafür.


The 9 two-way prepositions:

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

1) an, ans, am (DAT/ACC) = on, in, at, for, to
2) auf, aufs (DAT/ACC) = at, on
3) in, ins, im (DAT/ACC) = in, into

4) neben (DAT/ACC) = next to, beside, besides
5) hinter (DAT/ACC) = behind

6) über, übers (DAT/ACC) = over, above
7) unter (DAT/ACC) = under

8) vor (DAT/ACC) = in front of, before
9) zwischen (DAT/ACC) = between, among

Very often we use a prepositional pronoun with them. 

In this case, da(r)– refers always to the place (= object) where something is put, that has been mentioned in the preceding sentence or question.

All about Darum

darum
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

The adverb darum, depending upon its context in a sentence, most commonly has a topical meaning as "about," almost always in conjunction with the verb gehen:

Es ging eigentlich darum, Wohnraum zu schaffen in der Stadt.
= It was actually about creating living spaces in the city.
(schaffen = create)
(Wohnraum = living space)

Or as "therefore, which can also be alternately translated as "that's why" or "for this reason":

Darum nenn mich nie mehr dummes Huhn
= Therefore never call me "dumb chick" anymore.

You sometimes see darum as part of the separable verb darumstehen, which can translate as "to stand around" or "to stand around there," as opposed to the more common herumstehen ("to stand around" or "to stand around here"). Darumstehen can also mean to stand around something, as in um etwas herumstehen: 

Wir sehen das Fahrrad und die Kinder, die darumstehen.
= We see the bicycle and the children standing around it.
 
A slang usage of the adverb darum, however, is typically seen as a childish answer to a question, or an answer that is really no answer at all! 

Warum hast du das gemacht? -Darum! 
= Why did you do that? -Because!
