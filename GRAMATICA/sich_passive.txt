sich passive


In der Presse wie auch/como também im Fernsehen finden sich (= é encontrado, encontra-se) zunehmend Meldungen über die verheerenden Folgen des Spielens am Computer. (In the press as on TV, more and more reports on the devastating effects of PC games can be found)

This is the reflexive form of "finden" which is used here as a figure of speech to avoid an acting person in the sentence, very much in the same way as the passive voice is used in its English equivalent. "Sich" can only be used though with reflexive verbs.
